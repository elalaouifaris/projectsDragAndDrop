# projectsDragAndDrop

Project application done followinf the Udemy course on Typscript by Max. Schwartzm√ºller.

Main leanings:

- Using template tags to sketch how js framework use conponents is quite interesting. (proposed in the original course)
- Class definitions also following the course code, but implemented gradually while adding fetures.
- Leant the basics of how to implement drag and drop. Using typescript interfaces to formalize it is very informative.
- A little bug spotted when using Firefox. The drag & drop implementation for drop handler needs a preventDefault() call.
